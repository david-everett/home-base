# Fitness Data

Workout tracking and progress monitoring.

## Files

- `workouts.csv` — All logged exercises
- `goals.json` — Current PRs and targets

## Current Program

5x5 linear progression:
- 3 strength sessions per week
- Add 5lbs to lifts each session
- Deload when stalling

## Tracking

Log workouts with the `log-workout` skill:
```
"Log squat 200lbs 5x3"
"Logged a 5k run in 27:45"
```

Check progress with natural queries:
```
"How's my squat progressing?"
"Did I hit my workout targets this week?"
"What's my deadlift PR?"
```
